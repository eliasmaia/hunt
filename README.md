# Hunt
Hunt is a very simple mobile app, made with React-native. The app was made following up the React-Native course available at Rocketseat (https://skylab.rocketseat.com.br/node/curso-react-native). Hunt basically retrieves a list of objects from an api provided by the course, and shows the objects in a list with infinite scroll.
